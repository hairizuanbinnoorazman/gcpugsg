Google Cloud Platform User Group Singapore (GCPUG-SG) is a local Singapore organization whose focus is to get people from community to share their learnings and use cases in order to further understand the tools within Google Cloud Platform. Usually, such sharing are held with talks but we are aiming to have a different variety of formats to share content with other audiences.

From 2019, we might be experimenting with different forms of presenting content: Lightning Talks/Workshops etc. When we contact you, you can express which way of presenting content you would prefer.

## Volunteering as part of organizing team

The GCPUG community has always been growing and we now need more people than ever to help us coordinate and organize meetups/engage the community better. If you are interested to help out, reach out to us via the following form:
