Getting started with Kubernetes is not exactly a trivial thing to do. In order to prepare for the Kubernetes adventure, it would be good to go through some material below:

- Docker
  - Docker is the usual container runtime/tool alongside Kubernetes. Having some familarity with docker tooling would help in order to get one used to deploy applications onto Kubernetes.

  - https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/
- Microservices
  - Architecture design that is usually associated when deploying applications to Kubernetes. The spliting apart of the functionalities of an application into multiple services.
