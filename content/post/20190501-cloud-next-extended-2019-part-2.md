## Talk 2

Topic: Moving people and products with Machine Learning on Kubeflow

Synopsis: GOJEK, the Southeast Asian super app, has experienced a massive increase in customer growth by leveraging machine learning throughout its products. However, building production grade machine learning systems is still fraught with challenges and delays. In order to address these challenges GOJEK has adopted Kubeflow, a fully open source cloud native platform for machine learning.
In this talk you will learn how Kubernetes and Kubeflow empowers teams at GOJEK by increasing the speed at which they turn ideas into products. We will show how Kubeflow, which leverages Kubernetes and Istio, simplifies the process of rapidly training, deploying, and evaluating models.

Speaker: Willem Pienaar leads the data science platform team at GOJEK, working on the GOJEK ML platform, which supports a wide variety of models and handles hundreds of million of orders every month. His main focus areas are building data and ML platforms, allowing organizations to scale machine learning and drive decision making.

## Talk 3

Topic: Data Engineering and Machine Learning on production with GCP (which involves Big Query, Big Query ML, Kubernetes, Video Intelligence)

Synopsis: Introduction to 90 Seconds and how GCP services helped us (90 Seconds) productionize machine learning to deliver values directly to business.
We will also share a few examples / case studies / and best practices we have around this topic too.

Speaker: Dat

## Talk 4

Topic: Advances in stream analytics

Synopsis: Stream Analytics typically refers to continuous ingestion and output of data, with significant analytical transformations in between.

We will also walk through an end to end demo showing how all the pieces fit together.

Speaker: Reza Rokni, Developer Advocate - Google Cloud Dataflow and Apache Beam, Google. In his 6 years @Google, Reza has been lucky enough to work with developers from many industries from Gaming to Banking, applying Google's Data Analytics technologies to new domains. Currently as developer advocate for Google Cloud Dataflow and Apache Beam, he gets to have fun talking about stream processing all day long, or should that be stream processing unbounded... :-)

## Talk 5

Topic: Transforming Pets to Cattle with Infrastructure as Code

Synopsis: By applying software development principles to infrastructure, you can avoid provisioning and maintaining mutable “Pet” services by hand and transition to “Cattle” services managed by code driven automation.

Speaker: Daniel Poon, Lead Engineer (DevOps and Architecture): Wego. Daniel builds stuff for people that build stuff to empower them to build stuff better.

## Talk 6
