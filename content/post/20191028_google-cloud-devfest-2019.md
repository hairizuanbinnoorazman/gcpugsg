Topic: Learnings and Sharings of using DialogFlow to enable Speech Technologies in Singapore

Synopsis: IMDA has developed the National Speech Corpus (NSC) which is a large corpora of speech data for the purpose of improving and enabling speech technologies in Singapore. The Digital Services Lab (DSL) from IMDA has developed a suite of speech tools - Natural Speech and Transcription Technologies (NSTT) enabled by the NSC, which has been released to allow quick experimentation of speech technologies. Google’s Dialogflow was used together with the NSTT to develop a Proof-of-Concept of a speech-enabled AI assistant in a restaurant to receive orders to be sent to the kitchen.

The talk will focus on:

- Walkthrough of Developed Intents
- Intent Design Considerations
- Designing Text Responses
- Overall thoughts

A demonstration of the AI assistant will be shown to give the audience a feel of the state of speech technologies. The DialogFlow agent (intents & entities) developed by IMDA will also be made available via a licence.

A brief overview of the NSC and NSTT will also be presented.

Speaker: Kevin is a Project Manager at the Infocomm Media Development Authority in charge of the National Speech Corpus project.
