## Event details

There are 3 talks for this session!!

We would probably start the talk promptly at 7pm as there 3 pretty meaty topics so try to reach the location as fast as you can

### Talk 1

Topic: Knative
Speaker: Mete Atamel, Senior Developer Advocate - Google Cloud
Mete is a Developer Advocate at Google, focused on helping developers with Google Cloud. As a long-time Java and C# developer, he likes to compare the two ecosystems. Prior to Google, he worked at Microsoft, Skype, Adobe, EMC, and Nokia building apps and services on various web, mobile and cloud platforms. Originally from the island of Cyprus, he currently lives in Greenwich of London, not too far away from the prime meridian.

Sypnosis: When you build a serverless app, you either tie yourself to a cloud provider, or you end up building your own serverless stack. Knative provides a better choice. Knative extends Kubernetes to provide a set of middleware components (build, serving, events) for modern, source-centric, and container-based apps that can run anywhere. In this talk, weâ€™ll see how we can use Knative primitives to build a serverless app that utilizes the Machine Learning magic of the cloud.

### Talk 2

Topic: Devops, Secops & QA - and its future consolidation for commercial software
Speaker: Eugene Cheah, CTO & cofounder at Uilicious
Been working for over 12 years on various web technologies, and throwing them into production.
Now with a focus on automating user journey web testing of other web platforms, at scale with Uilicious. Helping companies, from startups such as Glints, to major enterprises with SAP.

Sypnosis: Looking into a possible future where where devops, secops & QA consolidates into a single delivery team, and will it mean for all of us.

### Talk 3

Topic: Live Kubernetes Debugging with the Elastic Stack
Speaker: Aravind Putrevu, Developer Advocate, Elastic

Sypnosis: Your Kubernetes app is down. Your users start ranting on Twitter. Your boss is standing right behind you. What do you do?

This talk walks you through a live debugging session without panicking:
What do your health checks say?
Where does your monitoring point you?
Can you get more details from your application's traces?
Is there anything helpful in the logs?
What the heck is even deployed?
