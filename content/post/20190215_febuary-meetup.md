## Event details

There are 2 talks for this session

### Talk 1

Topic: Using Machine Learning to meet Data Privacy requirements.

Speaker: Jason Quek from Avalon Solutions

Synoposis: General Data Protection Regulation states that European citizens have the right to request for access to their personal data, and that photos of themselves are considered personal data. With a large database of photos, companies run the risk of running afoul of regulations which can cost many millions in fines.

During this session, we will demonstrate how we use Machine Learning to solve this problem at different levels through facial recognition models and categorization of unstructured data, e.g. DNS entries.
As data privacy becomes a larger issue in Singapore, some of the techniques can be reused to ensure that data breaches can be detected and not compromised.

### Talk 2

Topic: Using BigQuery for Large Data Processing

Speaker: Nito Buendia, Customer Solution Engineer Google
Bio: Nito is a Customer Solutions Engineer at Google; working on building scalable automation and data solutions for Google's largest advertisers. During his tenure at Google, he has mainly focused on Automation and delivering solutions for teams to operate at 10x scale. He is passionate about empowering businesses through digitization and technology.

Sypnosis: BigQuery is Google Cloud's highly scalable, enterprise-ready data warehouse; which will allow you to focus on analyzing large data sets without worrying about the infrastructure. On this session, we will learn what BigQuery is and the benefits that can bring to your business and data projects. We will also explore some enterprise architecture examples and showcase how you can optimize and improve the performance of analyses.
