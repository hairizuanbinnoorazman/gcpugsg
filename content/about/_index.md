Google Cloud Platform User Group Singapore (GCPUG-SG) is a local Singapore organization whose focus is to get people from community to share their learnings and use cases in order to further understand the tools within Google Cloud Platform. Usually, such sharing are held with talks but we are aiming to have a different variety of formats to share content with other audiences.

In the future, we would add some open source projects that the core team members are working that would be great to be shared with the community. However in the mean time, just enjoy some of the resources/links that are shared here. They should prove useful to you if this is like your first time being aware of the meetup group and availability of cloud blogs/resources.
